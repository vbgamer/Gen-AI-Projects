I created a simple API using Flask. Then I used the "self-refine" technique by adding prompt-style comments in my code asking ChatGPT to improve things like performance, error handling, and formatting.

The AI helped me turn a basic app into a cleaner, more professional API with logging, input validation, and JSON responses.

1.✅ Improving performance and error handling

2.✅ Adding logging (to keep a record of what requests come in)

3.✅ Adding input validation (to make sure the name is not too long or weird)

4.✅ Returning results in JSON (which is the standard format for APIs)

5.✅ Using better server setup for real applications (instead of the default one)
